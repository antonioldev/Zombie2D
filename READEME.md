## Zombie Arena
In the Zombie Arena project, I built a survival shooter game where the player must fend off waves of zombies from a top-down perspective. The game features power-ups, weapon upgrades, and increasingly challenging enemy waves.

**Key Points**:
- **AI for Enemy Behavior**: I learned to create AI for enemy behavior, including pathfinding and attack patterns for the zombies.
- **Managing Multiple Game Objects**: I managed multiple game objects efficiently, such as the player, zombies, bullets, and power-ups.
- **Scoring System**: I implemented a scoring system to track the player's progress and provide feedback on their performance.
- **Advanced Collision Detection**: I tackled more complex collision detection and response, ensuring accurate interactions between the player, zombies, and bullets.
- **Game Optimization**: I applied game optimization techniques to ensure smooth gameplay, even with many active game objects.

## SFML Library
Throughout these projects, I used the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).W
hich is a cross-platform library designed to provide a simple interface to various multimedia components in C++.
SFML is particularly useful for game development due to its simplicity and ease of use.

**Key Features**:
- **Graphics**: Rendering shapes, sprites, and text. SFML makes it easy to draw 2D graphics and handle basic animations.
- **Windowing**: Creating and managing game windows. SFML provides a straightforward way to create windows and handle events such as resizing and closing.
- **Audio**: Playing sound effects and music. SFML supports various audio formats and allows for easy playback and control of sounds.
- **Input**: Handling keyboard, mouse, and joystick input. SFML simplifies the process of capturing and responding to user inputs.
